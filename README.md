# JESlideMenu â€“ iOS Slide-out Menu in Swift

JESlideMenu is an easy to use slide-out menu written in Swift 3. The slide-out menu can be easily added in an existing project. The design is completely written in code with autolayout, including a hamburger/toggle button. Therefore there is no need to add a toggle button, but you can if you want to.

## Requirements
- Xcode 8.x
- iOS 9 or above

## Preview
This is what the slider looks like without any customization. Only the headline **SIDEMENU** was added.

## How to install
### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is simple and decentralized package manager. To integrate JESlideMenu in your project, insert the following line in your Cartfile:

```
github "typesprite/JESlideMenu" ~> 1.1.0
```
And run `carthage update` one the console in your project folder to build the framework and drag the built `JESlideMenu.framework` into your Xcode project.

### Setup in Storybaord
- set JESlideMenuController as your initial View Controller
- give all your controllers (view, navigation, tab bar controller, etc.) a Storyboard ID in identity inspector
- enter the Storyboard IDs in the text fields (Menu Item 1...) in attributes inspector of JESlideMenuController
- style the menu via attributes inspector of JESlideMenu in the storyboard
- run the app

## Select custom font for menu headline
Use the following class methods to get all available fonts in your project.

```
JESlideMenu.printInstalledFonts()				  // prints all available fonts

JESlideMenu.printFontNames(familyName: "avenir")  // search for a specific font
```

## Trouble shooting
Make sure the Storyboard IDs of your controllers match the corresponding entry in "Menu Item". If you misspell the IDs, your app will crash.
